# Budget App

This code was developed as part of the Complete JavaScript Course 2020 created by Jonas Schmedtmann.


## How It Works

* The app calculates the available budget, considering the expenses and income
* It also shows the percentage of the budget for each and all expenses
* Every value should have a description and a value greater than 0
